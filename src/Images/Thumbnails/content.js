				✌🏽 1. Praise vulva diversity
				<br></br>
				By ending shame and insecurity
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				We want to provoke reflections on where our “normal and beautiful” standards came from. Our aesthetic preferences are intrinsically based on what we’ve been presented as visually pleasant by society. And in a patriarchal and phallic-centred society, the vulva suffers from underrepresentation and misrepresentation. Predominantly being reduced to “vagina”, even the word vulva still needs to conquer its righteous space. We’re surrounded by male genitalia, but we barely see any vulvas, and when we do, it’s sadly an inaccurate version of it. We are not presented with enough models of the wide diversity of vulval possibilities. So unconsciously, we end up perceiving ourselves through distorted lenses that don’t serve or empower us. But we have the power to break through this distortion and see our beautifully unique true selves.				<br></br>

				👄 2. Honour women’s sexuality
				<br></br>
				By revealing our innate potency
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Most women don’t understand their bodies and the ones that do and therefore celebrate it for what it is, see their sexual liberation being condemned. We want to close the orgasm gap caused by sexual ignorance and repression. We can free ourselves from these societal constraints by embracing our bodies for all the wonderful experiences they can provide us, instead of their appearance. We want to raise awareness not only about how a vulva looks like, but what it can give us. Let’s not limit ourselves to extending the body positive movement to our vulvas, but also evolve from this to a body neutrality point of view. To praise function over form. Women have the only organ that is exclusively dedicated to pleasure, the clitoris. And honouring our ability to have multiple and powerful orgasms improves our physical and mental health. Research shows that high sexual arousal can aid chronic pain, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety and even depression. So libido is not just sexual energy, it’s vital energy. It’s a driving force that propels us to find and be our truest selves.

				✨ 3. Spark Societal Liberation
				<br></br>
				By advocating empowerment & self-love
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				As long as we’re not fully comfortable in our skin, we’re not comfortable with ourselves. This inner conflict manifests into insecurities in all spheres of our lives. Most of the human suffering can be broken down into our inability to love ourselves completely. In an image-obsessed culture, we’re brainwashed into the illusion that we’re our appearance. But our bodies are nothing more than a vehicle for us to work on ourselves, physically and emotionally. Embracing our bodies for what they truly are and not what they look like is an essential key to achieving self-love and unlocking our full potential. And once we do, we start having a deeper connection with ourselves and others. To accept others, we first need to accept ourselves. Emerging from an individual into a collective level, societal liberation starts within us.

					<h3>To watch: Principles of Pleasure</h3>
					<p>
						We hope this Netflix series has gone mainstream already, but in case it has gone unnoticed by you, here is why we highly recommend The Principles of Pleasure.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can see the first episode, Our Bodies, as a delicious crash course on body anatomy, acceptance & awareness. It touches on sex education, masturbation, sex toys, orgasm and its health benefits.
					</p>
					<p>
						As Dr Nicole Prause, PhD. explained, "there are absolutely some conditions we likely can treat, as well or better, with masturbation than we currently are with some pharmaceutical drugs.”
					</p>
					<p>
						Giving your body more sexual stimulation is not only a journey towards more pleasure but also overall health. But unfortunately, “when women think they’ve orgasmed, half the time, they haven’t. Not necessarily because they’re faking it, but because they truly never had one”.
					</p>
					<p>
						F.Y.V. wants to help to change that by ending shame and insecurity not only related to our vulvas, but our whole bodies. We believe that’s the path to reveal women’s innate potency and enjoy all that it can offer us.
					</p>

				<span>Vulva fact: the labia minora can vary in width and length from woman to woman and that’s totally normal! </span>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				They range from 1–5 centimetres wide and the shape also varies from one side to the other (yes, they are not twin sisters!). Grab a mirror and admire the beauty of your unique vulva. Sometimes the labia minora is even bigger than the labia majora (that’s common for 50% of women). This scientific name can cause this confusion among women. It is a very subjective issue to define the "normal" vulva, but the most important thing is that you know that your labia is unique and will be different from others, and that’s completely NORMAL.				<br></br>

				<span>Vulva Casting by Vulvarium</span>
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				Viktoria Krug is the brilliant austrian artist behind the Vulvarium gallery and the vulva castings. Her project asks us to re-evaluate what we consider “normal” or “beautiful” and come to the conclusion that every single vulva is perfect just the way it is. Have a look at her @vulvacasting gallery to find out more about this beautiful work that blends art, self-knowledge, experiences, feelings and thoughts.
				<br></br>
				<br></br>
				As Viki said on her website: “They are all different, they are all powerful and their message is clear: Whatever your experiences with your vulva are like – you are not alone! There are thousands of women and people with vulvas out there who feel, have felt, or might in the future feel just like you do right now and your experience is normal and worthy of being talked about. Only through dialogue can old taboos be broken and new norms created so that one day we can live in a society that accepts women and people with vulvas as they are- and not as they want them to be.”
