				✌🏽 1. Praise vulva diversity
				<br></br>
				by ending shame and insecurity
			</p>
			<p>
				We want to provoke reflections on where our “normal and beautiful” standards came from. Our aesthetic preferences are intrinsically based on what we’ve been presented as visually pleasant by society. And in a patriarchal and phallic-centred society, the vulva suffers from underrepresentation and misrepresentation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Predominantly being reduced to “vagina”, even the word vulva still needs to conquer its righteous space. We’re surrounded by male genitalia, but we barely see any vulvas, and when we do, it’s sadly an inaccurate version of it. We are not presented with enough models of the wide diversity of vulval possibilities. So unconsciously, we end up perceiving ourselves through distorted lenses that don’t serve or empower us. But we have the power to break through this distortion and see our beautifully unique true selves.

				👄 2. Honour women’s sexuality
				<br></br>
				by revealing our innate potency
			</p>
			<p>
				Most women don’t understand their bodies... The few that do and therefore celebrate it for what it is, see their sexual liberation being condemned. We want to close the orgasm gap caused by sexual ignorance and repression. We can free ourselves from these societal constraints by embracing our bodies for all the wonderful experiences they can provide us, instead of their appearance. We want to raise awareness not only about how a vulva looks like, but what it can give us.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let’s not limit ourselves to extending the body positive movement to our vulvas, but also evolve from this to a body neutrality point of view. To praise function over form. Women have the only organ that is exclusively dedicated to pleasure, the clitoris. And honouring our ability to have multiple and powerful orgasms improves our physical and mental health. Research shows that high sexual arousal can aid chronic pain, sleep disorders, generalized anxiety and even depression. So libido is not just sexual energy, it’s vital energy. It’s a driving force that propels us to find and be our truest selves.

				✨ 3. Spark Societal Liberation
				<br></br>
				by advocating empowerment & self-love
			</p>
			<p>
				As long as we’re not fully comfortable in our skin, we’re not comfortable with ourselves. This inner conflict manifests into insecurities in all spheres of our lives. Most human suffering can be broken down into our inability to love ourselves completely.
			</p>
			<p>
				In an image-obsessed culture, we’re brainwashed into the illusion that we’re our appearance. But our bodies are nothing more than a vehicle for us to work on ourselves, physically and emotionally. Embracing our bodies for what they truly are and not what they look like is an essential key to achieving self-love and unlocking our full potential. And once we do, we start having a deeper connection with ourselves and others. To accept others, we first need to accept ourselves. Emerging from an individual into a collective level, societal liberation starts within us.
