            <p>
            Last month, Paula had the privilege of attending @secretgardenparty. A lot has been said about its poor infrastructure, but not enough about the amazing people that made the festival so worth it and magical even so. She said:
            </p>
            <p>
            "It was so liberating to be in the presence of confident women owning and loving their bodies, and that inspired me to free my body even more. Coming from a country where I couldn’t even show my legs without being extremely sexualised, I can’t explain the freedom and power that I felt from being topless in a festival”.
            </p>
            <p>
            If that wasn’t enough, she also had the honour to meet one of our inspiring muses there, @lydiareeves_artist ! A Female Body Casting Artist, Lydia allows people to celebrate their incredible bodies, and helps to eradicate any shame, embarrassment or negative thoughts that they may have encountered throughout their lives.
            </p>
            <p>
            And bringing body positivity and liberation to a new level, Paula also had the absolute pleasure of attending @bodymovementsfestival last month. The event is described as "Queer Bodies in Electronic Music". But she felt it should be sold as "The utopia of free bodies". She said:
            </p>
            <p>
            “The energy there was exhilarating and revitalising. I’ve never been surrounded by so many authentic and liberated people, who were celebrating themselves and each other. Walking with just a nipple cover in plain delight in Hackney Wick felt surreal. And this feeling says a lot about how far we are from being able to show and own our bodies however and wherever we chose. As long as something as natural as showing our skin feels surreal, we are still confined. So thank f*ck for Secret Garden Party and Body Movements! For giving me an escape from this sexually repressed society. For giving me the sweet taste of this liberated future that we’re working towards ❤️”.

        title: "Female Orgasm Day",

        content: <div>
            <p><span>Female Orgasm Day</span></p>
            <br />
            <p> Today is Female Orgasm Day and as much as we’d like to be only celebrating what our powerful vulvas can do for us, we must raise awareness of orgasm inequality.

                According to the International Academy of S3x Research, heterosexual men orgasm 95% of the time, gay men 89%, bisexual men 88%, gay women 86%, bisexual women 66%, and heterosexual women 65%.

                This striking gap of 30% between hetero men and women is just one of the many symptoms of a deeply patriarchal society, where women’s pleasure is not a priority., Laurie Mintz Ph.D. said, “the orgasm gap is a cultural problem.” And if you read more about it on On Psychology Today, you’ll see that the roots of this problem spread widely and they are not easily fixed. But we could tie the F.Y.V. manifesto to every single cause, which is even more validation of the importance of our work.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                And the great news is that this is one inequality that you can fight against with pleasure! According to the study, women who orgasmed more frequently were more likely to:

                -Receive more oral s3x
                -Have a longer duration of s3x
                -Be more satisfied with their relationship
                -Ask for what they want in bed
                -Wear s3xy lingerie
                -Act out fantasies
                -Praise their partner for s3x
                -Call or email to tease about s3x
                -Incorporate s3xy talk
                -Try new s3xual positions
                -Have anal stimulation
                -Express love during s3x
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                A lot of the items listed in the study involve being with a partner, but believe us when we say that nobody can please you as you can. It takes a lot of self-care and self-discovery, but it’s SO worth it.

                So honour this day by dressing s3xy just for yourself, taking a sweet long time m@sturbating yourself*, and maybe even acting out on fantasies on your own mind! Let’s fill this gap, one juicy orgasm at a time. 💦

                *We recommend at least 20 minutes, we’ll explain why in future posts 👀

                Paula not only organised a Bake Off at her work to raise money for charity, but also baked herself the most delicious and moist vulva vegan cake. And yes, the winning bidder could and should eat everything, especially the clitoris, which was literally the cherry on top!
            </p>
            <p>
                Just seeing the conversations that this sparked was already so rewarding and asking her colleagues - “Have you tasted my vulva?” - was priceless. But on top of that, her cake alone raised £240. And with all the other generous bakers contributions, an incredible total of £2666 was raised on that day!
            </p>
            <p>
                This amount was equally divided between four charities that @mvfglobal supports, one of them being @bloodygoodperiod. Their mission is to fight for menstrual equity, giving period products to those who can’t afford them and providing menstrual education to those less likely to access it.

                Any plans for the weekend? If you stay in London, why not have some friends' fun time and go out for a brunch & visit the first physical Vagina Museum? You can visit the main exhibition or have a look at the events that are happening there too!
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t miss this chance, you can book a free ticket on www.vaginamuseum.co.uk and discover great stories about our beautiful vulvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their current exhibition is called “Periods: A Brief History”: “Periods have been a taboo subject within society for thousands of years. Over 800 million people menstruate daily (Global Citizen, 2019) and over 50% of the global population will menstruate at some point in their lives, yet this natural process some bodies go through is something still shrouded in shame and stigma to this day.” Plus, they also have a permanent exhibition, called “from A to V”, which covers four main areas: anatomy, health, vulva diversity and activism.
            </p>
            <p>
                And if you are interested in their events, this Friday (29/Jul) and Saturday (30/Jul), they will be hosting a comedy called “Plan V: The Joyful Cult of Pussy Worship”. It starts at 7:30 PM and it’s only £5. Don’t miss that gathering of true believers, worshippers of the sacred pussy!
            </p>
            <p>
                The Vagina Museum is located in Bethnal Green, east London. You can book your tickets for the museum here: https://www.vaginamuseum.co.uk/booktickets and for the events here: https://www.vaginamuseum.co.uk/events/eventscalendar

                Looking for more open conversations about s3x? We highly recommend our muses from @comecurious, Florence @florencebark and Reed @reedamberx . They are the brains behind the award-winning podcast F**ks Given, sharing their experiences and opinion on sex, naked bodies and so much more. Bea found out about this podcast while she was still living in Brazil, a couple of years ago, and it keeps getting better and better!
            </p>
            <p>
                Removing the taboos around s3x, it talks about everything sex-related. One of their goals is to stop the shame around this important subject. We shouldn’t be ashamed to talk about our desires and what makes us feel good and powerful, right?
            </p>
            <p>
                Not only you’ll learn about sex from other people’s points of view (and here we’re talking about TRUE s3x, not porn-acted sex), but also give some good laughs with these two incredible women.

            <p>
                Understanding a person’s sexual orientation and gender identification might seem difficult at first. Especially when we’re young (and sometimes not so young too) and we’re still trying to figure out what we like and what we don’t like, what we are and what we are not. We’re complex human beings. We are born and assigned at birth as female, male and other/intersex. But we’re so much more than that! And that’s the beauty of it.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have the possibility to define ourselves in a spectrum of gender identity, gender expression, and to who we’re physically and emotionally attracted. There are no limits to expressing ourselves within our truth.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                It’s a must-see for all women, of all ages. We laughed, we cried, and for what we could hear, so did the whole audience. Emma Thompson was stunning, picturing a generation of women that lived their whole adult life disconnected to their bodies and pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The movie talks about the story of Nancy Stokes, a 55-year-old widow, who is yearning for some adventure, human connection, and exploring her sexual life (which hasn’t been very thrilling for the past 30 years). It is almost entirely filmed in a hotel room, so expect a lot of rich dialogues and deep reflections that will make you think about the movie for days and days.

            <p>
                It’s no shame if you don’t know exactly where the clit is either. Most women didn’t get a basic education in that subject. Female anatomy is not something that we are thought of when we were young (or even later in life). If you had that at school, you may consider yourself privileged. And there is sooo much taboo around it, which makes it even more difficult to reach our girls with quality information.
            </p>
            <p>
                But knowing your body, that’s power. For you to know who you really are and have access to your inner strength, you have to learn about every bit of yourself. It’s a matter of health (how can you explain to your doctor what are you feeling if you can’t label where the pain might be coming from?). It’s a matter of self-knowledge. It’s a matter of pleasure.

                There’s a false image about what a vulva should look like. It makes women think there is something wrong with their bodies. It makes them feel ashamed. And that makes them neglect their vulvas. Different is the norm. And we should celebrate this diversity as a way to create body-positive images to help women celebrate their bodies and feel proud of their vulvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was the concept for this incredible campaign designed for Bodyform. Aside from its stunning production, they also conducted global research delving into how women fell about their vulvas. Among the 8000+ women interviewed:
            </p>
            <p>
                - 68% don’t technically know what a vulva is (increasing to 73% in the UK)
                - 44% have felt embarrassed about their vulva (increasing to a shocking 63% of 18-24 year olds interviewed in the UK)
                - 50% feel pressure for their vulva to look a certain way
                - 25% are utterly unaware that no two vulvas should look the same
            </p>
            <p>
                As upsetting as these results are, we hope they don’t get you down. Instead, we hope they motivate you to keep sharing knowledge to end shame and insecurity. And we can’t think of anything more uplifting and empowering than watching the campaign in full <a href="https://tinyurl.com/watchvivalavulva" target="blank"> here</a>.

            <p>
                We must know the right terms to take full ownership of our body - and use them without constraint to end shame and insecurity around vulvas.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vagina is merely the canal that connects the uterus to the vulva. The almighty vulva encompasses all that meets the eye (aka the external parts): the pubic mound, the labias, the urethra and vagina openings, and last, but definitely not least, the powerful clitoris.
            </p>
            <p>
                Calling it a vagina is to reduce the vulva to a canal to either give birth or receive a penis. Calling it a vagina is one of the many symptoms of a deeply patriarchal society that oppresses female pleasure and sexuality.
            </p>
            <p>
                "Every time we use the word 'vagina' when we really mean 'vulva,' we're erasing the part that gives us the most pleasure," Laurie Mintz, professor of counselling psychology
            </p>
            <p>
                "Without knowing what is 'down there' and resorting to using pet names or blushing every time we refer to our private parts, just how comfortable can one be with one's sexuality, much less sexual expression?" - Martha Lee, clinical sexologist
            </p>
            <p>
                If you feel that the word vulva sounds too anatomical, it’s because it has never got the chance to live anywhere outside a clinical context. Language does shape how we think and feel. So let’s reclaim the word vulva and bring it to its righteous place! A place where it only conveys its relevance and power.

                This Netflix film covers a multitude of topics from second-wave feminism, by following iconic and fearless women that Cynthia MacAdams photographed in the 1970s. As hard as it is to condense such complex issues into a 1,5h timeframe, we felt they did a beautiful job of sharing light on feminist awakening.

                To celebrate the International Masturb@tion Day, here are our TOP 5 benefits of masturb@tion (we could easily list more than 5, but those are our favourite ones!):
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>1.</span> Releases good hormones like endorphins, serotonin and oxytocin (the cuddle hormone): a good dose of those amazing hormones is all we need to cheer you up and keep you in a good mood.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>2.</span> Reduces stress and anxiety: no pills, no side effects (well, just the good ones). being focused on your pleasure and nothing else is a great mindfulness exercise. Forget the bills, forget the work issues. Just concentrate on your D.I.Y time.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>3.</span> Allows you to fall into a deeper sleep more quickly: much better than a glass of wine and it won’t reduce the quality of your sleep like alcohol.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>4.</span> Reduces cramps when you’re on your period: that’s right! The more pleasure you give to yourself, the less pain your body signals your body will send. The next time you feel that period pain, try playing the piano!
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>5.</span> Helps you learn what you like in bed: the last but, in our opinion, one of the main benefits. No one will give you the best night in bed if you don’t know what and how do you like to receive pleasure. Create your ménage à moi moment and explore all your corners!

            <br />
            <p>
                Yes! We’re not talking about the stereotypical mainstream pornography that ignores women’s pleasure. We’re talking about the eroticism of human sexuality and relationships, people of different ages, races, sexuality, and gender, different body shapes, and identities. Hot, great porn that is made by women, for women.
            </p>
            <p>
                That’s why for this #maysturbate we’d like to present to you one of our favourite adult filmmakers: Erika Lust. Since 2014, Erika has been leading the revolution for adult cinema that goes beyond traditional gender roles and tired stereotypes, with a production that is ethical all the way. In 2019, Erika was named as one of the BBC's 100 Most Influential Women of the Year. That’s huge!
            </p>
            <p>
                So, ever wondered what ethical porn looks like? Find more about her wonderful work here: https://erikalust.com/about/about-erika And if you don’t know where to start, we want to recommend our personal favourite - Female Pleasure Circle. It’s a stunning and very artistic piece that made such an impact on our sexual journeys.

            <p><span>As long as we live in a society where there is scarcity and repression of pleasure, sexual health and well-being will continue to be overlooked and undermined. 					But the good news is that we live in times when we already have the validation of its importance by authorities like the World Health Organisation:</span></p>
            <br />
            <p>
                “Sexual health is fundamental to the overall health and well-being of individuals, couples and families, and the social and economic development of communities and countries.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sexual health, when viewed affirmatively, requires a positive and respectful approach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Bravo to all the doctors and scientists who worked so hard, against all the prejudice, to prove and share this knowledge. May is Masturbation Month, but do you know why? It marked the protests when Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders was fired for suggesting that masturbation should be taught as a part of sex education. And that was 1995, so sadly not long ago!
            </p>
            <p>
                So let’s honour month and its history with the safest and most pleasurable sex you can have. With yourself! If you haven’t experienced that level of satisfaction on your own, we encourage you to use this time to explore your body and find out what gives you pleasure. Nobody can know and love yourself as you do!

            <p>
                We hope this Netflix series has gone mainstream already, but in case it has gone unnoticed by you, here is why we highly recommend The Principles of Pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see the first episode, Our Bodies, as a delicious crash course on body anatomy, acceptance & awareness. It touches on sex education, masturbation, sex toys, orgasm and its health benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Dr Nicole Prause, PhD. explained, "there are absolutely some conditions we likely can treat, as well or better, with masturbation than we currently are with some pharmaceutical drugs.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Giving your body more sexual stimulation is not only a journey towards more pleasure but also overall health. But unfortunately, “when women think they’ve orgasmed, half the time, they haven’t. Not necessarily because they’re faking it, but because they truly never had one”.
            </p>
            <p>
                F.Y.V. wants to help to change that by ending shame and insecurity not only related to our vulvas, but our whole bodies. We believe that’s the path to reveal women’s innate potency and enjoy all that it can offer us.

            <p>
                They range from 1–5 centimetres wide and the shape also varies from one side to the other (yes, they are not twin sisters!). Grab a mirror and admire the beauty of your unique vulva. Sometimes the labia minora is even bigger than the labia majora (that’s common for 50% of women). This scientific name can cause this confusion among women. It is a very subjective issue to define the "normal" vulva, but the most important thing is that you know that your labia is unique and will be different from others, and that’s completely NORMAL.				<br></br>

                Viktoria Krug is the brilliant austrian artist behind the Vulvarium gallery and the vulva castings. Her project asks us to re-evaluate what we consider “normal” or “beautiful” and come to the conclusion that every single vulva is perfect just the way it is. Have a look at her @vulvacasting gallery to find out more about this beautiful work that blends art, self-knowledge, experiences, feelings and thoughts.
            </p>
            <p>
                As Viki said on her website: “They are all different, they are all powerful and their message is clear: Whatever your experiences with your vulva are like – you are not alone! There are thousands of women and people with vulvas out there who feel, have felt, or might in the future feel just like you do right now and your experience is normal and worthy of being talked about. Only through dialogue can old taboos be broken and new norms created so that one day we can live in a society that accepts women and people with vulvas as they are- and not as they want them to be.”
