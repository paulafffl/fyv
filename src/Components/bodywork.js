                        Extend your capacity to experience pleasure and unlock
                        your full innate power through your pussy. What I do is
                        create a space for you to embark on a journey of
                        self-knowledge and self-discovery - because we can’t
                        have the first without the latter.

                        You'll reframe the perception of your body and therefore
                        your relationship with pleasure. This takes place in an
                        optimal environment where all of your senses are looked
                        after. Smell, vision, sound, touch and even taste.

                        I'm aware that touch is what raises more questions, so
                        what happens exactly in this sense? You’ll first
                        experience a subtle touch to awaken your whole body.
                        Then a massage to activate your pelvic area. And last
                        but not least, I will massage and stimulate your vulva
                        and vagina - if you're receptive to it.

                        This form of bodywork is the compilation of the
                        learnings I had on Sexological Bodywork, Tantric Massage
                        and Terapia Orgástica. I named what I do Sensory
                        Bodywork because this goes beyond sex or orgasms. And
                        also to refrain from this being associated with the
                        endless and unfortunate deturbations of ancient sexual
                        knowledge. Unfortunately, there have been too many cases
                        of abuse and exploitation of vulnerable people under
                        those premises, even to the point of creating cults such
                        as the OneTaste Orgasmic Meditation.

                        This isn't to say that there aren’t amazing
                        professionals following these practices. But many women
                        cannot afford them. So I offer this Sensory Bodywork on
                        a <span>Pay What You Can</span> basis, as all women
                        deserve access to self-love and their own power.

                            I always felt a deep level of empathy and only found
                            as an adult that I’m a highly sensitive person.
                            Maybe because of that, I’m very passionate about
                            helping others. This led me to a wide variety of
                            volunteering work - with animal shelters, elderly
                            care, organic farms and soup kitchens. I’m also the
                            chair of the Corporate Social Responsibility
                            Committee and Women’s Network in the company I for.
                            And even though I see value in every single
                            experience I had, the most impactful way I gave back
                            to people, without doubt, is through this Sensory

                            There is so much untouched potential in most of our
                            sexual relations, with partners and especially with
                            ourselves. I came for the first time at the age of
                            25. Before then, I went through phases of
                            questioning whether I was physically capable of
                            orgasm, to think that I had already even though it
                            didn’t match any description I’d seen. I’m offering
                            this experience because I know I wasn’t the only one
                            feeling this way. I do this because I fear that most
                            women have only glimpsed the transformative power of
                            being in touch with their bodies. And ultimately, I
                            do this because I know it’s hard to be invested in
                            pursuing something you’re yet to experience and
                            therefore is beyond your comprehension. I hope to
                            share a light into your consciousness and show you a
                            new possibility. The possibility to embrace more
                            independence, self-love, awareness, and spirituality
                            into your life.

                    <p>
                        I believe the most basic human need is feeling loved.
                        And we are all taught, even if unwillingly, the
                        importance of pleasing others. But only a few of us
                        learn how to please and love ourselves.
                        <span>
                            {" "}
                            Society does not teach us that self-love is the only
                            one that we truly need. And as long as we depend on
                            anyone’s love and acceptance aside from our own, we
                            can’t be completely fulfilled.{" "}
                        </span>
                        I believe that learning how to please yourself is an
                        essential step to reaching this level of independence.
                        And with that, life becomes so much simpler and happier.
                        And even though you’ll be receiving pleasure from
                        someone else in this bodywork, all that I’ll be doing is
                        showing your own natural potency. Anything that you’ll
                        experience has always been within you. I’m just showing
                        you the door and then it’s up to you to go through it
                        and integrate what you learned. But it’ll always be
                        within your reach.

                    <p>
                        I learned to love myself completely once I started to
                        embrace my physical body as a vehicle. A vehicle for
                        both physical and emotional health. The importance of
                        looking after our bodies for our well-being is
                        well-known. But there isn’t enough light on how a
                        profound orgasm is a powerful means to the same end.
                        <span>
                            {" "}
                            It’s an orgasm that teaches you to worship your body
                            for its potency and not its appearance.
                            Independently of how we look, our bodies are
                            biologically designed to feel pleasure.{" "}

                        Every single cell of our skin is a receptor. By learning
                        how to activate all of those cells and have the
                        foundation on how to process this experience, you can
                        reach a truly transformative orgasm. And once you
                        witness where your body can take you, physically,
                        emotionally and spiritually, you naturally reach another
                        level of self-love.

                    <p>
                        What we’ll do is enhance your natural orgasmic potency.
                        Orgasmic potency is our capacity to support tension
                        before releasing it in the form of an orgasm. You can
                        see it as a rollercoaster: the bigger the tension, the
                        bigger the release will be. And when you have this
                        higher level of release, your brain reaches an altered
                        state of consciousness where wonderful things can
                        happen.

                            It has the power to maximise the amount of pleasure
                            in your whole life. Libido is vital energy, not just
                            sexual. So it can unlock an openness to all of your
                            five senses and all the pleasures that they provide
                            you.{" "}

                        You might even find yourself more creative or even
                        seeing things more clearly afterwards. That’s the result
                        of becoming more aware and in tune with yourself, which
                        leads to a fuller life.

                        Orgasm in French is called La Petite Mort, which means
                        “little death”. I feel it’s a very accurate term to
                        describe that moment in time when your ego and who you
                        think you are cease to exist - and you just be. You feel
                        completely in the present. Completely fulfilled. This is
                        what meditation is all about, to achieve this level of
                        presence. It just might take years of dedication to
                        reach that. But

                            portal” - which is the meaning of Yoni, the Sanskrit
                            word for a woman’s sexual organ. So in that sense, I
                            like to see orgasm as a faster and more accessible
                            way to sneak peek into enlightenment.{" "}
                        </span>
                        Independently of what spiritual work means to you, I
                        believe that it’s impossible to not feel connected with
                        something bigger than yourself when you reach these
                        different planes of consciousness through orgasm. You’ll
                        see your body as the temple that it truly is.

                        and so much love. Happy moments of my life kept popping
                        up in my mind. I accessed places that I didn't even
                        remember, and others that I didn't even know existed.
                        For a while, I completely forgot where I was. And I know
                        this didn’t make sense because I was sober, but

                        Night of 1000 suns. I walk home and I feel high,and it's
                        not because of the boots. I feel fast, and it's not
                        because of the scooter, I feel calm and strong. This is
                        a therapy, which is also a massage, which is also a
                        ritual. During the process I went through several layers
                        of emotions, sensations and thoughts, from relaxation
                        after the initial embarrassment, goosebumps at the

                        not being able to, of disappointing. But then, I

                        over, the cycle of thoughts diminished, sometimes the
                        sensations were so strong that the emotions disappeared
                        and I no longer knew exactly where my body began and
                        ended. I reached my first orgasm, a light and familiar
                        feeling, which was followed by a, also familiar, greater
                        relaxation of the body. I took a deep breath again and I
                        thought instinctively that we had finished the session.
                        But no, the movement and the music continued and I had a
                        second orgasm, also this light one, but I already felt
                        more relaxed and unconcerned, and I remember thinking,
                        now that the session is over. It was already quite
                        surprising given that I think it was the first time I
                        had 2 orgasms. But as the music changed I realised that
                        it didn't stop there. I genuinely thought that my body
                        had already given everything it had to give, but after a
                        few minutes when the music and the sensations came
                        together, I forgot everything and had a third orgasm.
                        But it was as if it had been the first, not of the
                        session, but of my life almost. It was very different,
                        pleasurable for sure, but more than that it was
                        powerful, I felt as if I had caused a ball of light to
                        be born throughout my body, and I felt as if I had left
                        my body with that light. And then, I went back and burst
                        into tears. Not out of sadness, but I think just out of
                        emotion, or energy. Whatever it was, I felt that I
                        released something and that with, a slightly different
                        version of me was born, who knows herself better and
                        carries courage in her womb.

                        You put me at ease more than I could have imagined and
                        made me feel comfortable in myself which really allowed
                        me to let go. I lost all sense of time with the eye mask
                        on and became completely absorbed in the physical
                        sensation. The pleasure that you gave me was, of course,
                        amazing, but my real appreciation comes from the fact
                        that it was such a selfless act on your part because it
                        was completely focused on me. This was a unique
                        experience because even doing a tantric massage with a
                        partner is in the context of a relationship where there
                        is reciprocation. So this act on your part of wanting to
                        devote your time, energy and emotion completely for my
                        pleasure was just magical. I loved sharing the
                        experience with you afterwards and seeing you cry with
                        me was so beautiful because your ability to feel such
                        compersion is so powerful. I am just so grateful to know
                        someone as special as you, and you are like no one else
                        I know in so many wonderful ways. I am forever in awe of
                        how you are expanding your mind and your experiences and
                        honoured that you want me and all your friends to share
                        in those experiences.

                    <p>
                        This Sensory Bodywork takes place in an optimal
                        environment where all of your senses are looked after.
                        I'll explain during the session how smell, vision, sound
                        and taste will be stimulated. I'm aware though that
                        touch is what raises more questions, so here is what
                        happens in this sense: you’ll first experience a subtle
                        touch to awaken your whole body. Then a massage to
                        activate your pelvic area. Last but not least, I will
                        massage and stimulate your vulva (the external parts of
                        a woman's genitalia) and if you’re receptive to this, I
                        can also stimulate your vagina (the internal part). For
                        this reason, you’ll be fully naked. You’ll be in full
                        control of the situation. Your consent can be withdrawn
                        at any time and I’ll cease to touch you as soon as you
                        tell me so.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Who can receive it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I only offer this Sensory Bodywork to women who are
                        vulva owners. I'd love to extend it to women with a
                        penis, but currently, my level of knowledge for this
                        genitalia is not enough as most of my learnings have
                        been focused on vulvas. As for men, I understand they
                        also need healing from all the toxic masculinity and
                        pressure that society has imposed on them. But as long

                        is a reality, I’ll prioritise women.

                    <h4>When can it happen?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The Sensory Bodywork happens during night time and it’s
                        not advisable that you plan anything afterwards, aside
                        from time to integrate and rest. You must send me an
                        Instagram direct message (or email) so we can schedule a
                        session. Please note that the waiting list can be from
                        weeks to months. It’s the most rewarding work I have
                        ever done, but it’s also very draining for me -
                        emotionally, physically and spiritually. And this is not
                        my job, I only do it to empower women, not to make
                        money. So because of that, I have a very limited amount
                        of time available.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Where does it take place?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Although I understand that some people would rather have
                        this in the comfort of their homes, I cannot guarantee
                        to deliver the same level of experience in different and
                        unknown spaces. The Sensory Bodywork takes place in an
                        optimal environment where all of your senses are looked
                        after. And for security reasons, I only share the exact
                        location after we have an initial 10min video call so we
                        can both feel safe embarking on this experience
                        together. The area is East London.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Why would I want this?</h4>
                    <p>
                        To extend your capacity to experience pleasure and
                        unlock your full innate power through your pussy. To
                        enhance your natural orgasmic potency. To reframe the
                        perception of your body and therefore your relationship
                        with pleasure. To embrace more independence, self-love,
                        awareness, and spirituality into your life.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How long does it last?</h4>
                    <p>
                        A Sensory Bodywork session takes around 2,5 hours. The
                        first 30min will be a conversation to understand a bit
                        of your history, needs and expectations. I'll explain
                        everything that will happen in more detail and share
                        some key learnings to help you connect with the
                        experience. Then there will be a 60-90min full body
                        massage - each person has their own pace and this is
                        what defines the length of this phase. It ends with
                        30min for integration, where you'll be able to process
                        this experience on your time, aside from taking a shower
                        if you wish so.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
                    <p>
                        I believe all women deserve access to self-love and
                        their own power, so I offer this Sensory Bodywork on a
                        Pay What You Can basis. I’m privileged to have a day job
                        to sustain myself. However, that means that my
                        availability to offer this is quite limited. So for
                        people who can afford and wish to support me
                        financially, similar bodywork in London costs from
                        £240-£400. I accept and appreciate any contributions as
                        this could allow me to reduce my working hours to
                        allocate more time for this.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How to prepare for it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        It’s advisable that you don’t consume alcohol or any
                        drugs before this Sensory Bodywork so you can be fully
                        present. Fasting is not advisable unless you’re used to
                        it - you don’t want to get distracted by hunger mid-way
                        through. You should eat in the same way you would before
                        doing an exercise.

                        Are people who experienced sexual trauma or abuse
                        suitable for this?

                    <p>
                        This Sensory Bodywork can be extremely healing for
                        people who experienced sexual trauma and abuse. However,
                        if this is your case, I don’t advise doing it without a
                        professional therapist to support you afterwards. To
                        treat wounds, they need to be brought to the surface.
                        And this Sensory Bodywork has the power to unlock
                        profound and deeply blocked memories. I’m a certified
                        Mental Health First Aider, so I’ll be equipped to
                        support you during the session. But afterwards, you
                        might need to be accompanied by therapy to be able to
                        process and integrate everything you experienced.
