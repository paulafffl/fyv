        📜 F.Y.V. Manifesto - Our 3 Pillars

        ✌🏽 1. Praise vulva diversity
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        By ending shame and insecurity
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        We want to provoke reflections on where our “normal and beautiful”
        standards came from. Our aesthetic preferences are intrinsically based
        on what we’ve been presented as visually pleasant by society. And in a
        patriarchal and phallic-centred society, the vulva suffers from
        underrepresentation and misrepresentation. Predominantly being reduced
        to “vagina”, even the word vulva still needs to conquer its righteous
        space. We’re surrounded by male genitalia, but we barely see any vulvas,
        and when we do, it’s sadly an inaccurate version of it. We are not
        presented with enough models of the wide diversity of vulval
        possibilities. So unconsciously, we end up perceiving ourselves through
        distorted lenses that don’t serve or empower us. But we have the power
        to break through this distortion and see our beautifully unique true
        selves.

    Hi! We’re Paula and Beatriz, friends that share, among many other things, a
    natural curiosity and la joie de vivre. We met in London in 2019 and since
    then, we’ve been living a journey of self-discovery and self-knowledge.
    Whenever one of us learned something new and inspiring, we’d share it with
    the other. One step at a time and each one on its own timing, we grew
    together.
    <br></br>
    As two white, cis, and able-bodied women, we’re aware that our privileges
    shaped our life experiences and consequently how we see the world. But we’re
    continuously striving to broaden our views and confront our unconscious
    biases. Our goal is to share what we learned and that we feel it’s
    meaningful to others, but as Einstein brilliantly said, “the more I learn,
    the more I realize how much I don't know.”. We’re just learners trying to
    expand our sight and hoping to bring others to join this open conversation
    with us.
    <br></br>
    I’m Beatriz (she/her), 30, also called Bea. I have a Latin Brazilian soul,
    Polish blood and a travelled mind. I can’t live without a good laugh and I
    like to think that unicorns existed. Sharing about our inner power is
    something that makes me happy and fulfilled!
    <br></br>
    I’m Paula (she/her), a 31 years old Brazilian that only recently fell in
    love with her vulva. It was such a transformative moment that I promised
    myself to commemorate it every year, by taking her out and treating myself
    to my favourite pleasures. I called it Vulverarsy. I had my first one this
    year and it was the most empowering experience to celebrate myself like
    that.
